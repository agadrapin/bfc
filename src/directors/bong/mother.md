    <p class="drop-cap">A mother's love is supposed to be unconditional. Bong Joon-ho takes that premise and follows it to its logical, devastating conclusion. <em>Mother</em> (2009) is a thriller about devotion pushed past all reasonable limits — and the terrible things that devotion can justify.</p>
    <p>Kim Hye-ja delivers a performance of such raw intensity that it redefines what we expect from the maternal figure in cinema.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p class="drop-cap">The unnamed mother lives alone with her intellectually disabled son Do-joon. When a young girl is found murdered and Do-joon is arrested as the prime suspect, she embarks on a desperate investigation to prove his innocence. What she discovers along the way forces her to confront not just the truth about her son, but the truth about herself.</p>
    <p>Bong constructs the film as a slow burn, alternating between dark comedy and genuine horror. The small-town setting feels both specific and archetypal — a place where everyone knows everyone, and secrets have a way of surfacing.</p>

  <div class="pull-quote">
    <p class="pull-quote-text">The film asks a simple question: how far would you go for someone you love? Then it shows you the answer is further than you think — and further than you should.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>Kim Hye-ja's performance is the film's centre of gravity. She manages to make the mother sympathetic even as her actions become increasingly morally questionable. We understand her, even when we're horrified by her.</p>
    <p>The final act delivers one of Bong's most unsettling reveals — not a twist in the conventional sense, but a recalibration of everything we thought we understood. The dancing that bookends the film takes on an entirely different meaning by the end.</p>

  <div class="pull-quote">
    <p class="pull-quote-text">The dancing that bookends the film is the key to everything. In the beginning, it's strange. By the end, it's an act of survival — a desperate attempt to forget.</p>
    <span class="pull-quote-accent"></span>
  </div>

  <div class="prose">
    <p><em>Mother</em> is Bong at his most restrained and his most devastating. It's a film about the lies we tell ourselves to survive, and the costs of love that refuses to see clearly.</p>
