    <p class="drop-cap">The Coen Brothers have always had a gift for finding the absurd inside the brutal, and the brutal inside the mundane. <em>No Country for Old Men</em> (2007) is perhaps their most uncompromising statement — a film that strips away genre comfort and leaves you with something closer to a reckoning. It is thrilling and funny and frightening, sometimes all within the same scene, and it earns every minute of its two hours and three minutes.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p class="drop-cap">What I enjoyed most is the story and the way it is told — the Coens exercise a rare restraint here, trusting the script and the landscape to do the work that lesser directors would assign to a score. The near-total absence of music is not a stylistic quirk but a deliberate choice that makes every scene feel exposed, every silence a potential threat. The tension that builds in those quiet stretches is more effective than any conventional thriller device.</p>
    <p>The film puts you through a wide range of emotions. It will surprise you, shock you, make you laugh, and scare you — sometimes in the same breath. Great angles, a witty script, and performances calibrated to perfection make this an excellent picture wrapped in neat frames and very precise writing.</p>

    <p class="pull-quote-text">A minimalistic approach to music creates an even bigger tension in many scenes. The silence is the score.</p>

  <div class="prose">
    <p>Javier Bardem freaks me out — intentionally and completely. Anton Chigurh is one of cinema's great monsters not because he is supernatural but because he is logical, and his logic is impeccable and terrifying. Opposite him, Tommy Lee Jones is absolutely hilarious as Sheriff Bell, a man grappling with a world that has outpaced his understanding of it. His weariness is the film's moral centre. And then there is young Woody Harrelson, whom I personally adore in anything after watching the first season of <em>True Detective</em> — here brief, charismatic, and very funny.</p>
    <p><em>No Country for Old Men</em> is possibly something I would watch again, and with a lot of pleasure. Definitely a no-miss for anybody who proudly states they love cinema.</p>
